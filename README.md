# BoligaData

A project to develop a machine learning model to predict apartment prices in Copenhagen.

The project consists of three parts:
 - Collect data by web scraping sold apartments from www.boliga.dk.
 - Clean, geocode and integrate with other data sources, e.g. Metro stations.
 - Test different machine learning algorithms.

The aim of the project is to execute an end-to-end machine learning project, from messy data to a (hopefully) well performing model. 

# To-do
The project is still in the early stage, the data have been scraped and partially cleaned. 


- Data preparation
   - Cleaning data - done
   - Calculate distance to nearest Metro station
   - Other geographical attributes, e.g. waterfront area

- Modelling
   - Linear regression - initialized
   - Random forest
   - SVM
   - Ensemble models
   - more?
